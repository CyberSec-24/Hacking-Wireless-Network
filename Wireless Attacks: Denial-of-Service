Wireless networks are vulnerable to DoS attacks because of the relationships among the physical, data-link, and network layers.

These networks operate in unlicensed bands with data transmission in the form of radio signals.

The designers of the MAC protocol aimed at simplicity, but it is vulnerable to DoS attacks. 

WLANs usually carry mission-critical applications such as VoIP, database access, project data files, and Internet access.

Disrupting these applications on WLANs through a DoS attack is easy and can cause a loss of productivity or network downtime.

Wireless DoS attacks disrupt wireless network connections by broadcasting de-authenticate commands. 

The transmitted de-authentication forces the clients to disconnect from the AP

Wireless DoS attacks include disassociation attacks and de-authentication attacks. 

▪ Disassociation Attack
In a disassociation attack, the attacker makes the victim unavailable to other wireless devices by destroying the connectivity between the AP and client

▪ De-authentication Attack
In a de-authentication attack, the attacker floods station(s) with forged de-authenticates or disassociates to disconnect users from an AP.
