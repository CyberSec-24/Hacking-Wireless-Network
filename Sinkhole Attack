A sinkhole attack is a variant of the selective forwarding attack in which the attacker advertises a compromised or malicious node as the shortest possible route to the base station.

The attacker places the malicious node near the base station and attracts all the neighboring nodes with fake routing path information and further performs a data forging attack. 

Attackers use the compromised node to sniff and manipulate all ongoing network transmissions.

A sinkhole attack can also be performed simultaneously with a wormhole attack, where the malicious node can occupy all the network traffic and use the tunneling technique to reach the base station faster than other nodes. 

A sinkhole attack is complex to detect, and it can adversely affect higher-layer applications in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
