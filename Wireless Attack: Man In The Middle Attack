A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is an active Internet attack in which the attacker attempts to intercept, read, or alter information transmitted between two computers. 

MITM attacks are associated with 802.11 WLANs as well as wired communication systems

▪ Eavesdropping 
Eavesdropping is easy in a wireless network because no physical medium is used for communication.

An attacker in the vicinity of a wireless network can receive radio waves on the wireless network without much effort or equipment. 

Furthermore, the attacker can examine the entire data frame sent across the network or store it for later assessment.
Several layers of encryption need to be implemented to prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive information. WEP or data-link encryption can be used in these layers. 

Further, a security mechanism such as IPsec, SSH, or SSL must be used, failing which sent data may be available to attackers. 

However, as demonstrated in a previous section, an attacker can crack WEP with tools freely available on the Internet. 

Accessing email using the Post Office Protocol (POP) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is risky because these protocols can send an email over a wireless network without any form of extra encryption.

A skilled hacker can potentially log gigabytes of WEP-protected traffic, post-process the data, and break the encryption


▪ Manipulation
Manipulation is a level beyond eavesdropping. 

It occurs when an attacker receives the victim’s encrypted data, manipulates it, and retransmits the manipulated data to the victim. 

In addition, an attacker can intercept packets with encrypted data and change the destination address to forward these packets across the Internet.


MITM Attack Using Aircrack-ng An attacker can perform an MITM attack using aircrack-ng through the following steps.

▪ Run airmon-ng in the monitor mode. 
▪ Start airodump to discover SSIDs on the interface.
▪ De-authenticate (deauth) the client using aireplay-ng
▪ Associate the wireless card (fake association) with the AP to be accessed with aireplay-ng
