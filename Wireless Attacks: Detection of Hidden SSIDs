Based on the principle of security through obscurity, many organizations hide the SSID of their wireless networks without broadcasting them.

This is part of the security policy of many organizations because an attacker may take advantage of the SSID to breach the security of their wireless networks. 

However, hiding SSIDs does not increase security. An attacker can reveal a hidden SSID using the aircrack-ng suite and mdk3 through the following steps

▪ Run airmon-ng in the monitor mode using the command airmon-ng start <Wireless interface>. If any process causes trouble, first run airmon-ng check kill command.

▪ Start airodump-ng to discover SSIDs on the interface 

▪ Open another terminal as root and run mdk3 <Wireless Interface> p -b 1 -c <Channel> -t < Target BSSID> command to brute force and retrieve the actual hidden SSID

In the command,
o p: Basic probing and ESSID Brute-force mode
o -b: Beacon flood mode o 1: EAPOL logoff test 
o -c: Selection channel (here, 2) 
o -t: Target BSSID (here, 1C:3B:F3:40:10:74) 
o wlx00e02d886189: Wireless interface
