802.11i: 
It is an IEEE amendment that specifies security mechanisms for 802.11 wireless networks.

WEP:
WEP is an encryption algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. It is an old wireless security standard and can be cracked easily.

EAP: 
The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) supports multiple authentication methods, such as token cards, Kerberos, and certificates.

LEAP: 
Lightweight EAP (LEAP) is a proprietary version of EAP developed by Cisco. 

WPA: It is an advanced wireless encryption protocol using TKIP and Message Integrity Check (MIC) to provide strong encryption and authentication. 
It uses a 48-bit initialization vector (IV), 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC), and TKIP encryption for wireless security.

 TKIP: It is a security protocol used in WPA as a replacement for WEP. 

WPA2: It is an upgrade to WPA using AES and the Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) for wireless data encryption.

AES: It is a symmetric-key encryption used in WPA2 as a replacement for TKIP. 

CCMP: It is an encryption protocol used in WPA2 for strong encryption and authentication.

WPA2 Enterprise: It integrates EAP standards with WPA2 encryption. 

RADIUS: It is a centralized authentication and authorization management system. 

PEAP: It is a protocol that encapsulates the EAP within an encrypted and authenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel.

WPA3: It is a third-generation Wi-Fi security protocol that provides new features for personal and enterprise usage. 
It uses Galois/Counter Mode-256 (GCMP-256) for encryption and the 384-bit hash message authentication code with the Secure Hash Algorithm (HMAC-SHA-384) for authentication
