After completing the wireless network discovery, mapping, and analysis of the target wireless network, an attacker will be in a position to launch an attack on the target wireless network. 

The attacker may launch various types of attacks such as fragmentation attacks, MAC spoofing attacks, DoS attacks, and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning attacks. 

This section describes wireless attacks and how they are performed

Aircrack-ng is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2) cracker, and analysis tool for 802.11 wireless networks.

This program runs under Linux and Windows

▪ Airbase-ng: It captures the WPA/WPA2 handshake and can act as an ad-hoc AP. 
▪ Aircrack-ng: This program is the de facto WEP and WPA/WPA2 PSK cracking tool.
▪ Airdecap-ng: It decrypts WEP/WPA/WPA2 and can be used to strip wireless headers from Wi-Fi packets.
▪ Airdrop-ng: This program is used for the targeted, rule-based de-authentication of users.
▪ Aireplay-ng: It is especially effective for gathering initialization vectors (WEP IVs) and WPA handshakes, which can then be utilized with aircrack-ng for further analysis and potential network security testing.
▪ Airgraph-ng: This program creates a client–AP relationship and common probe graph from an airodump file.
▪ Airmon-ng: It is used to switch from the managed mode to the monitor mode on wireless interfaces and vice versa.
▪ Airodump-ng: This program is used to capture packets of raw 802.11 frames and collect WEP IVs.
▪ Airolib-ng: This program stores and manages ESSID and password lists used in WPA/ WPA2 cracking.
▪ Airtun-ng: It creates a virtual tunnel interface to monitor encrypted traffic and inject arbitrary traffic into a network
