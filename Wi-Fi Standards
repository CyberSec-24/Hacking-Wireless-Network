802.11: 
The 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard applies to WLANs and uses FHSS or DSSS as the frequency-hopping spectrum. 
It allows an electronic device to establish a wireless connection in any network.

 802.11a:
It is the first amendment to the original 802.11 standard. 
The 802.11 standard operates in the 5 GHz frequency band and supports bandwidths up to 54 Mbps using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). 
It has a high maximum speed but is relatively more sensitive to walls and other obstacles

802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6):
Wi-Fi 6, also known as 802.11ax, is the latest generation of Wi-Fi and enhances the foundation of 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5).
It supports speeds of up to 9.6 Gbps, uses orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) to efficiently manage multiple connections, and improves performance in crowded areas through features such as BSS Coloring and target wake time (TWT).
Wi-Fi 6 is ideal for dense environments, such as stadiums, airports, and smart homes with many connected devices

 802.11b: 
IEEE extended the 802.11 standard by creating the 802.11b specifications in 1999. 
This standard operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and supports bandwidths up to 11 Mbps using direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation

 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7):
Wi-Fi 7, also known as 802.11be, is an emerging standard that aims to significantly improve Wi-Fi 6/6E. 
It supports speeds of up to 30 Gbps, uses a multilink operation (MLO) to aggregate multiple channels across different bands, and reduces the latency for real-time applications. 
Wi-Fi 7 was designed for future-proof, ultrahigh-speed Internet, virtual reality, augmented reality, and advanced IoT applications

802.11d: 
The 802.11d standard is an enhanced version of 802.11a and 802.11b that supports regulatory domains. 
The specifications of this standard can be set in the media access control (MAC) layer.

IEEE 802.11e: 
It is used for real-time applications such as voice, VoIP, and video. 
To ensure that these time-sensitive applications have the network resources they need, 802.11e defines mechanisms to ensure quality of service (QoS) to Layer 2 of the reference model, which is the MAC layer.

802.11g: 
It is an extension of 802.11 and supports a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps using OFDM technology. It uses the same 2.4 GHz band as 802.11b. 
The IEEE 802.11g standard defines high-speed extensions to 802.11b and is compatible with the 802.11b standard, which means 802.11b devices can work directly with an 802.11g AP

 802.11i: 
The IEEE 802.11i standard improves WLAN security by implementing new encryption protocols such as the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

802.11n: 
The IEEE 802.11n is a revision that enhances the 802.11g standard with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. It works in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.
Furthermore, it is an IEEE industry standard for Wi-Fi wireless local network transportation. Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and WLAN use OFDM

802.11ah: 
Also called Wi-Fi HaLow, uses 900 MHz bands for extended-range Wi-Fi networks and supports Internet of Things (IoT) communication with higher data rates and wider coverage range than the previous standards

802.11ac:
It provides a high-throughput network at a frequency of 5 GHz. It is faster and more reliable than the 802.11n standard.
Moreover, it involves Gigabit networking, which provides an instantaneous data-transfer experience.

802.11ad: 
The 802.11ad standard includes a new physical layer for 802.11 networks and works on the 60 GHz spectrum. 
The data propagation speed in this standard is much higher from those of standards operating on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, such as 802.11n

 802.12:
Media utilization is dominated by this standard because it works on the demand priority protocol. The Ethernet speed with this standard is 100 Mbps. 
Furthermore, it is compatible with the 802.3 and 802.5 standards. Users currently on those standards can directly upgrade to the 802.12 standard

 802.15:
It defines the standards for a wireless personal area network (WPAN) and describes the specifications for wireless connectivity with fixed or portable devices.

802.15.1 (Bluetooth):
Bluetooth is mainly used for exchanging data over short distances on fixed or mobile devices. This standard works on the 2.4 GHz band.

 802.15.4 (ZigBee): 
The 802.15.4 standard has a low data rate and complexity. The specification used in this standard is ZigBee, transmits long-distance data through a mesh network.
The specification handles applications with a low data rate of 250 Kbps, but its use increases battery life

802.15.5: 
This standard deploys itself on a full-mesh or half-mesh topology. It includes network initialization, addressing, and unicasting

 802.16: 
The IEEE 802.16 standard is a wireless communications standard designed to provide multiple physical layer (PHY) and MAC options.
It is also known as WiMax. This standard is a specification for fixed broadband wireless metropolitan access networks (MANs) that use a point-to-multipoint architecture.
